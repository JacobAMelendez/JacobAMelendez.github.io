        Austin (/ˈɔːstɪn/ AW-stin, UK: /ˈɒstɪn/ OST-in)[7] is the capital of the
        U.S. state of Texas, as well as the seat and most populous city of
        Travis County, with portions extending into Hays and Williamson
        counties. Incorporated on December 27, 1839,[8] it is the tenth-most
        populous city in the United States,[9] the fourth-most populous city in
        the state after Dallas, San Antonio and Houston, and the second-most
        populous state capital city after Phoenix, the capital of Arizona.[10]
        It has been one of the fastest growing large cities in the United States
        since 2010.[11][12][13] Downtown Austin and Downtown San Antonio are
        approximately 80 miles (129 km) apart, and both fall along the
        Interstate 35 corridor. This combined metropolitan region of San
        Antonio–Austin has approximately 5 million people.[14] Austin is the
        southernmost state capital in the contiguous United States and is
        considered a Beta-level global city as categorized by the Globalization
        and World Cities Research Network.[15](Wikipedia contributors, 2024a)
